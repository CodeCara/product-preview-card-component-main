## My process

I used feedback from FEM and needed some assistance from YT tutorials for this one as it was first time trying to do a FEM project - I will try to develop a more personal/independent process as I move forward

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

As this is my first project, I did not take notes on what I learned as I went along (something I will pay more attention to in the future), but from memory, I learned the following:

- Using srcset and the picture element to enable different images to be selected according to media queries

- how to use the BEM naming convention

- incorporating custom properties

- how to use a utility class for screen-readers

- how to make a page responsive (first time doing this)

### Continued development

- want to continue using the BEM naming convention for consistency (still new to it, but will try to use it in all projects to keep things organised)

- although I found the solution to the screenreader adjustments, it is still very new to me and I probably need to read around a bit more to understand what I am doing a bit better and to be able to apply it comfortable to other projects

- although I have seen custom properties before, I have avoided using them up to now, but would like to incorporate them more going forward and to start using them as standard where necessary

- I used a base-16 for REM here and have used base-10 in the past. I need to choose one and stick to it (both seems to have different pros and cons)

- I need to read more about the applications of the picture element and the srcset attribute - I used them, but definitely need to understand their uses better
